## What is tane?

Tane is a Bushido Developers best friend and a development tool. It
helps you generate new Bushido capable apps. It also enables existing
Ruby on Rails Apps to be Bushido friendly.

## How To Create A New App

Install the tane gem and run the `tane create` command to create a new
app.

The create command will then make a new directory using that passed
name. If you don't pass a name, it will ask you for one.  The create
command will use the directory specified to generate a new rails 3 app
based on a Bushido app template.
