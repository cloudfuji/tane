Usage:

    tane exec any_command
    
Executes any command specified in a simulated Bushido environment. The following example shows you how to run rails applications.

    tane exec rails s

This is how you should be running Bushido rails applications locally. All the configuration required for `tane exec` is obtained from `.bushido` directory in the current directory. This can only be used if `tane init` has been run in the current directory.
